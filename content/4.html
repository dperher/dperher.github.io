<h1> AI for a quicker automation </h1> Automation is becoming more and more prevalent in many industries, from manufacturing to finance and beyond. This is made possible in part thanks to advances in artificial intelligence (AI). AI enables computers to take on tasks that were traditionally done by humans, freeing up time and resources to focus on more complex tasks. In this blog post, I will discuss the various ways AI can be used to automate processes, from natural language processing to data engineering. I will also provide examples of how AI is being used to speed up automation in different industries. Finally, I will provide tips and tricks on how to get started with AI for automation.</body>
